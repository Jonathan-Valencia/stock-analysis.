 - perform data analysis using VBA

  ###  Overview of the Project
  - The overview of the project was to explore the Visual Basic of Aplications aka VBA to learn the coding concepts that will help us perform more complex analyses. As we used the example in our model, I came to understand that VBA was helping me learn the fundamental building blocks of programming languages. As well as Learning to code is essentially learning how to deconstruct a problem and translate the solution into simple instructions. At the end I was able to programmatically analyze multiple stocks with skills such as syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.
