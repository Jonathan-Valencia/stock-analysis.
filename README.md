# Stock-Analysis.
 - perform data analysis using VBA

 # Overview of the Project.
  - The overview of the project was to explore the Visual Basic of Aplications aka VBA to learn the coding concepts that will help us perform more complex analyses. As we used the example in our model, I came to understand that VBA was helping me learn the fundamental building blocks of programming languages. As well as Learning to code is essentially learning how to deconstruct a problem and translate the solution into simple instructions. At the end I was able to programmatically analyze multiple stocks with skills such as syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.
  ### More General Purpose and Data 
  - The purpose of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect certain stock information in the year 2017 and 2018 and determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing. This process was originally completed in a similar format, however, the goal for this round was to increase the efficiency of the original code.
  - The data that is presented includes two charts with stock information on 12 different stocks. The stock information contains a ticker value, the date the stock was issued, the opening, closing and adjusted closing price, the highest and lowest price, and the volume of the stock. The goal is to retrieve the ticker, the total daily volume, and the return on each stock.
